# Cub3D Project Overview

## Introduction
Cub3D is a graphics project that recreates a basic raycasting engine similar to Wolfenstein 3D. This project teaches fundamental concepts of computer graphics, including raycasting, texture mapping, and basic game engine architecture.

## Project Steps

### 1. Map Parsing and Validation
*(Detailed implementation in parsing.md)*
- Parse `.cub` file format with specific rules
- Validate map content (walls, spaces, player position)
- Handle map elements (NO, SO, WE, EA textures and F/C colors)
- Implement flood fill for map validation
- Process configuration elements before map data
- Ensure proper error handling for invalid files

### 2. Window Management and MinilibX Setup
*(Detailed implementation in window-management.md)*
- Initialize MinilibX and create window
- Set up double buffering system
- Handle window events (close, minimize, focus)
- Manage window state and resources
- Implement proper cleanup procedures
- Handle graphics context and errors

### 3. Minimap Implementation
*(Detailed implementation in minimap.md)*
- Create minimap structure and initialization
  - Scale definition (pixels per map unit)
  - Position in main window
  - Image buffer management
- Implement rendering functions
  - Draw map grid with walls and floors
  - Draw player position and direction
  - Handle proper scaling
- Create helper drawing functions
  - Square drawing for map cells
  - Circle drawing for player
  - Line drawing for direction
- Integrate with main game loop
  - Update on player movement
  - Efficient redrawing
- Add testing and debugging features
  - Validate map representation
  - Check player position accuracy
  - Verify collision visualization

### 4. Player Controls and Movement
*(Detailed implementation in controls.md)*
- Implement key mapping structure
  - WASD for movement
  - Arrow keys for rotation
  - ESC for exit
- Create player movement system
  - Forward/backward movement
  - Strafe left/right
  - Rotation controls
- Add collision detection
  - Wall collision checks
  - Buffer zones for smooth movement
- Integrate with game loop
  - Process multiple key states
  - Handle smooth movement
  - Update player position
- Implement optimization features
  - Frame-independent movement
  - Efficient collision checks
  - Smooth acceleration/deceleration

### 5. Graphics and Raycasting Core
*(Detailed implementation in graphics-raycasting.md)*
- Set up core raycasting components
- Implement DDA (Digital Differential Analysis) algorithm
- Calculate wall distances and heights
- Handle texture mapping
- Manage image buffers
- Draw floor and ceiling
- Optimize rendering performance

### 6. Error Handling and Memory Management
*(Detailed implementation in error-handling.md)*
- Implement consistent error reporting
- Handle file operation errors
- Validate configurations
- Manage memory allocation
- Implement resource cleanup
- Handle runtime errors
- Add defensive programming measures
- Ensure graceful error recovery

## Testing and Validation
